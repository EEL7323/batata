# Project Short Descpription
This project consists in develop an access control system to ufsc refectory. This system might work online and offline. 
A Leon3/Atlys board is used to store users using data structures, unlock the turnstile for authorized users and send data to host computer.
The host computer is a web server containing an SQL database of users and purchases, a web API with user interface to generate reports.
Users can have two accounts: One related to RFID RU card; and other related to their smartphone app. 
The smartphone app might be able to connect with the turnstile and the server, in order to grant acces to ru and get reports from server.
